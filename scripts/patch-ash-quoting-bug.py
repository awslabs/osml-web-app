"""Patch the ASH scanner plugins to fix the --skip-path/--exclude quoting bug.

Affects ASH v3.2.1 through at least v3.5.2. Re-run against newer versions to
confirm whether it's still needed.

Bug: ASH builds scanner CLI arguments with f-strings that embed literal
double-quotes around the value, e.g.
    f'--skip-path="{item.path}"'   ->   --skip-path="cdk.out"
Because there is no shell in between, the quotes are passed verbatim as part
of the argv value. The downstream tool (checkov, bandit) then compiles a
regex that contains literal `"` characters, which can never match a real file
path. Exclusions silently fail.

Fix: remove the embedded quotes so the value is passed cleanly:
    f'--skip-path={item.path}'   ->   --skip-path=cdk.out

This script is idempotent: it creates a backup once (`*.pre-quoting-patch.bak`)
and exits cleanly if the file has already been patched. Upstream fix lives in
.kiro/specs/ash-quoting-bug/NOTES.md — remove this patch once ASH ships it.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/patch-ash-quoting-bug.py
Exit codes:
    0 - patched successfully, or already patched
    1 - ASH not importable (not installed in the active Python)
    2 - unexpected file contents (patch did not apply cleanly)
